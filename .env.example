# Environment variables for type-bridge
# Copy this file to `.env` (or set vars in your shell) to override runtime behavior.

# NODE_ENV controls runtime environment (development|test|production)
# Default: not set — Node will treat this as 'development' in many libs.
NODE_ENV=development

# TYPEBRIDGE_SKIP_FORMAT
# When set to '1' the TS generator will skip requiring Prettier.
# This is useful for test runs or CI environments where you don't
# want Prettier to open TTY/stdin handles.
# Default: unset (formatting enabled during normal CLI runs)
TYPEBRIDGE_SKIP_FORMAT=0

# Notes:
# - Jest sets JEST_WORKER_ID automatically during tests. Do NOT set it manually.
# - This project does not require any database URL or credentials to run the
#   CLI in most example cases — the parsers read local schema/model files.
# - If you run parsers that need optional packages (e.g., Mongoose), install
#   the package in the project so parsers can import them without warnings.

# For clarity: `JEST_WORKER_ID` is injected by Jest when running tests.
# The code checks `process.env.JEST_WORKER_ID` to detect test runs and
# skip Prettier formatting to avoid TTY handles. Do not add this to your
# permanent `.env` file; it's managed by the test runner.
# Example (only for local simulation):
#   PowerShell:  $env:JEST_WORKER_ID = '1'
#   Bash:        export JEST_WORKER_ID=1
